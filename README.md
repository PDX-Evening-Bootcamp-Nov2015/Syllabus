## Responsibilities

You are responsible for getting to and attending class.  Please be on time and be prepared to work.  You will need to bring a laptop, maintain your development environment and check in your code using git.

Do not leave class without push all changes to your github account.  Professional developers are constantly committing code changes.  You should try to build this important habit.

You are responsible for your own learning.  If you do not understand something do not stay silent.  We will be building complexity as we progress through the course.  It is imperative that you speak up if you don't fully understand a concept as it will hamper your progress through the course.

## Projects/Portfolio

All code that you write should be tracked using git for version control.  As you progress through the bootcamp you will be creating an on-line portfolio to show prospective employers.  Be sure that you keep your code clean and have README files for each piece of your portfolio.  

## Code of Conduct

* Actively participate in all classes and exercises.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow class mates.  Treat both with respect.

We take this very seriously.  Given the collaborative nature of the program and our commitment to diversity, you will be asked to leave the bootcamp if you do not follow the guidelines.

If something happens that makes you feel uncomfortable involving a classmate, instructor or staff please speak to me or Sheri Dover immediately.

### Hygiene

Due to the collaborative nature of this course please take appropriate measures to make sure you are pleasant to work with.
